# WebDAV Browser App

This simple Flask web application provides a split-screen layout with a video player on the left and a basic browser on the right. You can load a video from a WebDAV URL and browse any website side by side.

## Usage

1. Install the dependencies (Flask):
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
4. Enter your WebDAV video URL and the website URL you want to browse.

This app is provided for demonstration purposes and uses the GPL-3.0 license like the rest of the project.
